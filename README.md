# IMDb

IMDb is a mini IMDb clone app using only vanilla javascript & css framework like Bootstrap.


Features 
-> Search any movie from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions)

-> Each search result of the movie should have a favourite button, clicking on which the movie should be added to “My favourite movies” (a list).

-> On clicking any particular search result (any movie), open a new page with more information about that movie (movie page)

Movie Page

-> Should show information about the movie like its name, photo, plot, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

My favourite movies Page

-> Display a list of all the favourite movies.

-> Make this list persistent (should have the same number of movies before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).

-> Remove from favourites button: Each movie should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that movie from the list.
